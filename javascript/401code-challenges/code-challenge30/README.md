# hashtable

## Challenge

Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

set
- Arguments: key, value
- Returns: nothing
  - This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
  - Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
get
- Arguments: key
- Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
has
- Arguments: key
- Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
keys
- Returns: Collection of keys
hash
- Arguments: key
- Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Structure and Testing

- Setting a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
- Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
- Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
- Successfully returns a list of all unique keys that exist in the hashtable
- Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
- Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
- Successfully hash a key to an in-range value

Time = O(n)<br/>
Space = O(n)
