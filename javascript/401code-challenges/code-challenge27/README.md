## Challenge

Write a function called mergeSort<br/>
Arguments: array<br/>
Return: array<br/>
returns the original array with all values numerically sorted in order.

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
<br/>
Run [npm test code-challenge27] to run tests.
