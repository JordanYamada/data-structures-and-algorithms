# stack-queue-pseudo

## Challenge

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

### Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Stack and Queue classes.
