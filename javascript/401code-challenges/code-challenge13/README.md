# stack-queue-brackets

## Challenge

Write a function called validate brackets
Arguments: string
Return: boolean
representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced
There are 3 types of brackets:

- Round Brackets
- Square Brackets
- Curly Brackets

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Stack and Queue classes.
